Repository Analyzer:

This .glom file has a "Begin Scan" button that uses python-apt 
to examine a debian repository and fill the database with information 
about the packages.

The repository or repositories are specified in the sources.list file 
that is written by the buttons's script.

Open this file with glom to create the database on your server.
You will need Glom >= 1.2.0.
